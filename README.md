### Local Development

For development purposes, you can:

   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .

## 🔧 Customization

### Colors
The design uses Spotify's brand colors:
- Primary Green: `#1db954`
- Black: `#000000`
- White: `#ffffff`

### Typography
- Responsive font sizes using Tailwind's responsive utilities

### Layout
- Maximum width: 1536px (max-w-6xl)
